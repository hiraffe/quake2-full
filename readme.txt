================================= Quake 4 Mod =======================================

You are a hunter. Your goal is to sneak up on enemies and kill them, either sneak up on them and get attack before they notice you or chase after them.

Stealth Mechanics:
When you walk around normally, your footsteps are loud and will alert enemies when you get too close.
Press C to crouch. It will lower your speed and you will also move more quietly.
Press D to dash. It will make you move quickly forward, but makes a loud sound.
Press Q or E to peek around a corner, so that you can spy on enemies from behind a wall or crate. Q lets you peek to the left and E to the right.

Weapons:
You can use the rail gun to set a trap and when an enemy steps on it, they can't move anymore, but they can still shoot at you.
You can use the grenade launcher to set a more powerful trap that immediately kills an enemy once it is trapped.

Powerups:
Invisibility: enemies cant see you and don't notice when you shoot
Disguise: enemies ignore you, but are alerted if you start shooting at them
LightStep: Your normal footsteps dont make a sound
Silencer: Your weapons dont make a sound
Speed: Your walking speed is faster
